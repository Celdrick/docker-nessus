# docker-nessus

This is a [Nessus Vulnerability Scanner](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner) container based on the [CentOS image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/). This build is linked to the upstream [CentOS](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/), so any updates pushed to the upstream will trigger an automated build of this image.

This image does not contain the activation keys, so you need to grab your own [here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-plugins/obtain-an-activation-code).

Any questions please open a new issue.

PRs are also welcome.
